            <h1>Welcome to Memedom!</h1>

            <p>
                On the 26th of June 1892, Jose Rizal's arrival in Manila caused quite a commotion in the country. Being one of the <i>Illustrados</i>—the educated Filipino class—the Spaniards were pressured by Rizal's presence. By this time, Rizal's works were openly known in the country and by the Spaniards.

            <p>
               As he had planned, on July 3rd of the same year, Rizal founded La Liga Filipina in the house of Doroteo Ongjungco in Tondo, Manila. The organization's goal was to have a Filipino representative in the Spanish Cortes—not for a revolution that Spaniards had speculated.
            </p>

            <p>
                Days later, the Spanish authority arrested Rizal to Fort Santiago to be soon exiled in Dapitan for <b>four</b> years because of the following charges:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    For publishing anti-catholic and anti-friar books and articles;
                </li>
                <li>for having in possession a bundle of handbills, the <i>Pobres Frailes</i>—a leaflet about Dominican friars and their corrupt acts,</li>
                <li>dedicating his novel, <i>Noli me Tangere</i> and <i>El Filibusterismo</i> to the <i>GomBurZa</i> (Father Gomez, Burgos, Zamora), and</li>
                <li>criticizing the religion and aiming for its exclusion from Filipino culture.</li>
            </ul>

            <slidedown-box title="But, hey. What do we mean by 'exile'?">
                <p>
                    Exile means "to banish or expel from one's own country or home" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.).

                <h2>II. Rizal Life in Talisay, Dapitan</h2>
                <p>
                    On September 21, Rizal won a PHP 20,000 lottery with Carnicero. His portion amounts to PHP 6,200, which he used to buy land in barangay Talisay, where Rizal built a house, a school, and an eye clinic. With the help of Carnicero, he wrote a letter to the Governor General to allow his mother and sisters in Dapitan. Additionally, he also beautified the Dapitan Plaza, stood lampposts around the town, and organized a clean water system for the people.

                <p>
                    On the 4th of May 1893, Carnicero was replaced by <b>Captain Juan Sitges</b>. He did not want to live with a deportee, and he assigned Rizal to live in a house near the headquarters. He ordered Rizal to appear before him three times a week.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, Rizal had many visitors in Dapitan, one of which was <b>George Taufer</b> with his eighteen-year-old adopted daughter <b>Josephine Bracken</b> who came along. There also came <b>Pablo Mercado</b> (his real identity, <b>Florencio Namaan</b>), a spy of the friars who posed as Rizal's relatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During that time, Rizal had a relationship with Josephine Bracken, even wanting to get married only to get opposed by Fr. Obach. Despite that, the couple considered themselves official. The couple even had a son, who soon died three hours after birth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rizal's affection for Bracken was pretty obvious. However, Rizal's relatives and friends distrust Josephine, suspiciously thinking she might be a spy from the Spanish government because Brackens' tour guide, Manuela Orlac, was close to the friars.

                <p>
                    Soon, maybe far later, another visitor was <b>Pio Valenzuela</b>&mdash;an emissary of Andres Bonifacio&mdash;telling Rizal about the founding of Katipunan and asking for advice on how to launch a revolution.
                </p>
                <slidedown-box title="What was Rizal's response?">
                    <p>With cadency, Rizal outspokenly objected to the idea of the revolution for the reason of</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the Filipino people lacked preparedness for such a devastating revolution,</li>
                        <li>the Katipunan lacked weaponry—considering how large the Spanish military strength, and</li>
                        <li>the lack of support of the rich and influential people of Manila to strengthen their cause,</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite this, Rizal also advised Antonio Luna as their general and leader of the revolution. Rizal also warned that many innocents would die, giving them an insight into the possible consequences of the revolution.</p>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>Valenzuela also told Rizal of their plan to rescue him in Dapitan. Again, the exiled hero disagreed because he had no plan of breaking his word of honor to the Spanish authorities.</p>
